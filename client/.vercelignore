# Exclude large instance .txt files from deployment
# Keep index.json which is needed for the puzzle library
# Use specific patterns to exclude only .txt files

# Exclude all .txt puzzle files (but not index.json)
public/instances/**/*.txt
dist/instances/**/*.txt
.vercel/output/static/instances/**/*.txt

# Exclude entire subdirectories that only contain .txt files
# This is safe because index.json is in the instances root, not in subdirs
public/instances/6x6/
public/instances/12x12/
public/instances/general/
public/instances/logic-solvable/
public/instances/daily-puzzles/

# Exclude root instances directory (outside client/)
instances/

# Exclude development files
node_modules/
.vscode/
*.log
.DS_Store

# Exclude build artifacts (but Vercel needs dist/, so be careful)
# dist/  # Don't exclude - Vercel needs this
build/
.vercel/

# Exclude test files
*.test.js
*.test.jsx
*.spec.js
